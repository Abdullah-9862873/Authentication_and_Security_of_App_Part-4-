# Authentication_and_Security_of_App_Part-4-

Used passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose and express-session to make the website secured instead of bcrypt... In this way I'll have cookies installed in my browser and I can just login once and then I am fully authenticated and then I can access the secrets page anytime from the browser but once the server gets restarted then I have to login again in order to install the cookies in my browser again...  

Using passport, allows the browser to fetch and use the hash and salting methdods automatically and in this way the browser or the login page is fully secured...
